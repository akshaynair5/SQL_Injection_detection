# SQL Injection Detector

A Python library to detect SQL injection attempts using machine learning.

## Installation

```bash
pip install sql_injection_detector

from sql_injection_detector.detector import SQLInjectionDetector

detector = SQLInjectionDetector()
detector.load_model()
result = detector.predict("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 OR 1=1")
print("Prediction:", result)


Creating a comprehensive and informative README file is crucial for helping users understand how to use your project and what it offers. Here is a detailed example of what you can include in your README file for the SQL injection detection project:

# SQL Injection Detector

## Overview

The SQL Injection Detector is a Python library designed to help developers detect and prevent SQL injection attacks. It uses machine learning techniques to identify potentially harmful SQL queries and can be easily integrated into existing web applications to enhance security.

## Features

- **Machine Learning-Based Detection**: Utilizes logistic regression and text vectorization to identify SQL injection attempts.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into any Python-based web application.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Logs all predictions and generates detailed reports on detected SQL injection attempts.
- **Batch Processing**: Supports processing multiple queries at once.
- **Configurable Alerts**: Allows configuration of alerts for detected SQL injections.

## Installation

To install the SQL Injection Detector, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install sql_injection_detector
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql_injection_detector.git
cd sql_injection_detector
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the SQL Injection Detector in your project:

```python
from sql_injection_detector.detector import detect_sql_injection

# Example query to test
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 OR 1=1"

# Predict using the function
result = detect_sql_injection(query)
print(f"Prediction: {result}")
```

### Generating Reports

To generate a report of all detected SQL injections:

```python
from sql_injection_detector.detector import generate_detection_report

# Generate report
report = generate_detection_report()
print("Detection Report:")
print(report)
```

### Training the Model

If you want to train your own model with a new dataset, use the following code:

```python
from sql_injection_detector.detector import SQLInjectionDetector

detector = SQLInjectionDetector()
detector.train()
```
